    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">
      How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web
      security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be
      greater than 250 words
    </p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">
      I would advise the client to make use of secure authorization and
      authentication, and to not store passwords in plain-text in the event that
      there is a breach. Staff would be trained to recognize phishing attempts
      and to ensure that the correct procedures are followed, such as making
      sure payments are cleared with the accounting department before they get
      paid to a party. I would tell them to sanitize the input data from the
      user and ensure that they aren't using JavaScript parsers such as
      innerHTML. This is to prevent script injections. I would also advise them
      to validate the input on the front-end before it gets sent to the backend,
      but not to rely on this, only to make the back-end developer's lives
      easier. The back-end should still validate and sanitize the data without
      fault. I would advise them to make use of a CDN (Content Delivery Network)
      so that if they are a victim of DDoS (distributed denial-of-service)
      attacks then the traffic load could be shifted elsewhere.
